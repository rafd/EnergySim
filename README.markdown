EnergySim
=========

A energy-based neighbourhood simulation. The goal is to provide a platform for evaluating various technology scenarios in terms of economic and environmental sustainability. 

Project consists of a Modelica library for neighbourhood-scale energy-flow modelling and various technology scenarios for the Annex neighbourhood in Toronto, Canada.

This project is being completed as part of the 2011 Energy Systems Engineering Capstone project for the Engineering Science division at the University of Toronto.
